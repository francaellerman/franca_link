        <p>Hi! I'm <a href='/home'>Franca Ellerman</a>, a rising senior at Lexington High School and Ben Borgers stan.</p>
        <p>What sets this Blocks replacement apart from the others is its quick set up and Google Calendar integration. It doesn't really need much explanation, just use it to learn about it.</p>
        <p>Thank you to Ben Borgers for starting this beautiful, possibly annoying, tradition of forcing LHS to adopt a new schedule app every year or two, and to Ali Mosallaei for continuing it. Also thank you to my friends and my dad for all supporting me in my endeavors.</p>
